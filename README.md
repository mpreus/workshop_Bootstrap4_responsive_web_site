# workshop_Bootstrap4_responsive_web_site

Internet site of a fake construction company developed as an exercise in Bootstrap4 course. 
Even though it's been made under the tutorial of the video course, I've written every line of the project. 
That help me to understand Bootstrap4 mechanisms and develop my skills in it. 
The site as it appeares in the repo slightly differs from the original one.
